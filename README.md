Special project completed during the 2nd year of my undergrad: Earth Observation using Machine Learning to Analyze Satellite Data to Monitor and Predict Weather Patterns, Natural Disasters and Climate Change.

Leveraged satellite data to predict weather of various cities. Researched and compared different models. 

The project aimed to analyze weather data using machine learning techniques for Earth observation purposes. The analysis was conducted using Python programming language and various libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and scikit-learn. The project utilized a dataset containing weather data for Bengaluru.

The workflow included data preprocessing, where numerical features such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, heat index, UV index, feels like temperature, and wind chill were selected for analysis. Correlation analysis was performed to understand the relationships between these features. The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a 80-20 ratio.

Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression models were implemented to predict the temperature (`tempC`) based on the selected features. The models were trained on the training data and evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Variance score, Residual Sum of Squares, and R2-score. Predictions were made on the testing data and compared with the actual values using visualizations generated using Plotly and Matplotlib.

The project provided insights into the performance of different regression models in predicting temperature based on weather features. It demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in analyzing weather data for Earth observation purposes. Through this analysis, the project aimed to enhance understanding of weather patterns and their impact on the environment.
